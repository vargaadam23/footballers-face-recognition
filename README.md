# Football player face recognition mini application

This mini application written in python serves as a face recognition tool for popular football players.

The face recognition algorithm I used in order to achieve this was the Fisherfaces Algorithm, using the cv2 python library.

New football players can be added to the database by creating a new directory with the player's name and populating it with images that contain the player's face.
